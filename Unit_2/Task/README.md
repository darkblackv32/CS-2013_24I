# Task 2 - Unit 2
## Topic: Templates and Metaprogramming
---


### Question #1
Write the template function get_maximum_product_range that takes a generic container as a parameter and returns a container with the elements that produce the maximum product obtainable by multiplying elements from the container.

### Question #2
Defines a function generate_matrix that constructs a matrix of specified size from given container data. The matrix is filled row-wise until all elements of the data container are used. If the matrix size exceeds 
the number of data elements, remaining cells are filled with zero.

### Question #3
Develop the function template generate_polynomial that allows generating a function that returns the value of a polynomial f(x) for a given value of x. The function template could have two or more parameters that allow generating the polynomial: f(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + fx^5 + gx^6 + â‹¯ . (VARIADIC TEMPLATE)

### Question #4
Implement a copy constructor and the move constructor for the `book` class.
