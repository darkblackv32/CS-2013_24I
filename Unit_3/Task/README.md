# Task 3 - Unit 3
## Topic: Iterators and Containers
---


### Question #1
Design and develop a function template equal_values that, in linear time O(n), allows you to identify if two containers of the same size contain the same elements, regardless of the order of their values. Example:

```cpp
container_1 = { 1, 4, 5, 19, 20, 11, 22, 1 };
container_2 = { 1, 1, 4, 5, 11, 19, 20, 22 };
