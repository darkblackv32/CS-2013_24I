### Question #1
Implement a copy constructor and the copy assingment operator for the book class that performs a deep copy of the title and author strings to avoid shallow copy issues.

### Question #2
Add a move constructor and the move assingment constructor to the book class that efficiently transfers ownership of resources from temporary objects.

### Question #3
Implement the < operator for the book class to compare two books based on their titles alphabetically. Return true if the title of the current book is less than the title of the other book.

### Question #4
Overload the == operator for the book class to compare two books based on their titles. The operator should return true if the titles are the same, and false otherwise.

### Question #5
Create Your Own Class Challenge:
- Design a new class inspired by the `book` class, mimicking its constructors and overloads.
- Utilize pointers and explore various constructor designs to enhance your class's functionality.
- Choose a topic that excites you and allows for creative exploration.
- Implement all necessary constructors and operator overloads, aiming for versatility and elegance in your class design.


Don't overlook creating usage examples for exercises 3, 4 and 5â€”it's key to understanding and applying the material.
